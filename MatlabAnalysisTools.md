# PCA #

`performPCA` perform PCA on a result.txt

## Usage ##

In MATLAB -- for a given results.txt file, e.g. at (Users/username/Desktop/script\_demo/movie\_demo/result.txt) that has been generated by ca\_script in a project, do this to run PCA and visualize:

  * RUN MATLAB
  * Change the path to `/Applications/Programming/softwarestudies/matlab/analysis` (this is standard for software studies script kit install)
  * Run the command

```
[data, headers, filesnames] = readResultFile('/Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo/result.txt');
```

  * Run the command

```
performPCA(data,filesnames,'/Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo',100)
```

where path is the project directory (assumes /images) and
100 = size as units of the axis, whatever they may be

# ShotAnalyzer #

`shotAnalyzer` computes per-shot averages from a result.txt

## Usage ##

In MATLAB -- for a given results.txt file, e.g. at (Users/username/Desktop/script\_demo/movie\_demo/result.txt) that has been generated by ca\_script in a project.

  * RUN MATLAB
  * Change the path to `/Applications/Programming/softwarestudies/matlab/analysis` (this is standard for software studies script kit install)
  * Run the command

```
[s,h] = shotAnalyzer('/Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo/result.txt','/Users/username/Desktop/output.txt')
```

  * `output.txt` will be generated and can be located in `/Users/username/Desktop`

# Summarizer #

`summarizer` computes averages of each column from a result.txt

## Usage ##

In MATLAB -- for a given results.txt file, e.g. at (Users/username/Desktop/script\_demo/movie\_demo/result.txt) that has been generated by ca\_script in a project.

  * RUN MATLAB
  * Change the path to `/Applications/Programming/softwarestudies/matlab/analysis` (this is standard for software studies script kit install)
  * Run the command

```
[s,h] = summarizer('/Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo/result.txt','/Users/username/Desktop/output.txt')
```

  * `output.txt` will be generated and can be located in `/Users/username/Desktop`
